# water-bottle-solver
This Java program solves a generalized version of the classic "water bottle puzzle," allowing the user to interactively simulate bottle operations like filling, emptying, and pouring between any number of user-defined bottles. The program prints the state of all bottles after each move and ends once one of them reaches the target amount. The logic is modularized using a WaterBottle class to manage state and operations.

The program checks for illegal moves and uses clean function separation for clarity and reusability.
